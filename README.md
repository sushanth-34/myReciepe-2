step1 - 1. Firstly measure and keep all the ingredients ready for making atte ka halwa.

step2 - 2. In a kadai or pan, add 2 cups water.

step3 - 3. Next add 1 cup sugar. I have used organic sugar hence the color is slightly golden. You can use regular sugar or organic sugar. You can even use jaggery powder.

step4 - 4. Heat the water and sugar. We just need to make a sugar solution.

step5 - 5. Let the solution come to a boil. We have to add this hot boiling sugar solution to the flour mixture once its roasted well. But do make sure that there are no thread consistencies formed in the sugar solution. The sugar solution just needs to come to a boil.

step6 - 6. Meanwhile, in another heavy kadai or pan, add Â½ cup ghee. Remember to use thick bottom kadai so that the atta does not get burnt. Keep both the pan on two burners simultaneously. So that once the flour is roasted, the sugar solution is also hot.

step7 - 7. When the ghee becomes hot, then add 1 tablespoon cashews (kaju). instead of cashews you can also add almonds in the halwa at this stage.

step8 - 8. Fry the cashews till golden. Remove the fried cashews and place aside.

step9 - 9. In the same kadai (or pan), add 1 cup whole wheat flour (atta).

step10 - 10. Stir and mix very well.

step11 - 11. Roast the whole wheat flour, stirring continuously till the color of the flour changes. Roast the atta on a low to medium-low flame.

step12 - 12. You will soon get the aroma of roasted whole wheat flour. keep on stirring to ensure even browning.

step13 - 13. When the atta or whole wheat flour has turned golden, gives a good nutty fragrance and starts to release ghee.

step14 - 14. Then add the bubbling hot sugar and water solution to the atta mixture. be careful as the mixture has the tendency to splutter.

step15 - 15. Continue to stir and mix very well. You cannot take a break at this step. So stir continuously.

step16 - 16. Keep on stirring so that lumps are not formed.

step17 - 17. Next add the fried cashews. If you wanted to add pista (pistachio) in the wheat halwa, then you have to add them at this stage. No need to fry the pista before adding.

step18 - 18. Keeps stirring continuously. the atte ka halwa will absorb water and will continue to thicken quickly.

step19 - 19. When the wheat halwa consistency is semi thick or thick like a Sooji halwa and the ghee is also released from the sides. switch off the flame.

step20 - 20. Serve atte ka halwa hot or warm. For more delicious halwa varieties, you can check this collection of 31 halwa recipes.
